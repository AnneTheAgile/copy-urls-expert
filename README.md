Author, my hero for this addin, last posted 2013.11 on Firefox addins page [1], and his own homepage was suspended [2], so I hunted to find this git repo. 

So here is its 'about' info;

About this Add-on
Overview

Copy Urls Expert comes in handy when you want to copy a bunch of urls. It provides you a few possibilities:

    Copy urls of all tabs in every opened window.
    Copy urls of all tabs only in the current window.
    Copy urls of all links in the selection.
    Copy urls of all images in the selection.


You can also open multiple links at once by using 'Open Tabs' menu.

To access these functions, find 'Copy Urls Expert' menu at following places:

    Menubar -> Edit Menu
    Firefox AppMenu -> Edit Menu
    Tab Context Menu
    Selection Context Menu
    Copy Urls Expert Toolbar button (You will have to add button manually. How to add button?)

Customization

The format in which links are copied to clipboard is highly customizable. See the extension's options dialog. Following parameters allow you to customize each url:

$url - Actual link e.g. http://google.com/
$title - Title of the tab e.g. Google
$n - New Line.
$index - Serial number of link.
$date - Today's date

Remember that by default urls are not placed on new lines so $n must be used anyways.

Very useful.
Proposal: Add a feature to delay loading of tabs after importing a clipboard-list of urls. Similar to open a restored session in Firefox, delaying actual loading of content until the tab is activated.
Great Add-On! Rated 5 out of 5 stars

I Love this add-on. I replaced "CopyAllURLs" with it because it wasn't updated any more. Please consider adding the following to this and it will be perfect:

1) Ability to copy or paste urls with a keyboard shortcut like how it is in "CopyAllURLs" [ctrl+ alt + v/c]

2) Ability to sort urls by tab groups and have the tab group names as headers in the clip board. Example: I have 3 groups of tabs named Search results, News and Stock Quotes. I go into the menu and select "Copy Urls Expert -&gt; Tabs In This Window"

the result will be copied to the clipboard

Search Results
http://url1.com
http://url2.com
http://url3.com

News
http://url1.com
http://url2.com
http://url3.com
http://url4.com

Stock Quotes
http://url1.com
http://url2.com
http://url3.com

Some suggestions ... :) Rated 4 out of 5 stars

I'd suggest you to add a simple filter ( in right click menu ) that could manage KEYWORDS filtering options. The way i can set to copy only links that contain the word "download=ID" from selection or from the entire page. Then please, add also a option to copy ALL TABS LINKS from tabs opened on the RIGHT\LEFT from active. This would be a great improvement. Thanks

Lets me select a bunch of lines as they were simple text and the extension gets the links! It can get links of several web sites. I used this extension to download several hundreds of images from a Manga reading site by coping the titles of the links to each chapter, and the extension got the links to each image of each episode in each chapter!! Then with Jdownloader it was very easy to get all the pictures to have my collection of the Manga I was reading, to read offline or print out! Cool! :D

Thank you very much!

This one is really good. I set it by default to be a one-click copier for the current tab since that his how I do most my link copying. For a power-user such as myself just cutting a click or two adds up over time.

I used to use Copy URL but that one recently stopped working. I contacted Kasif about this one and he responded quickly. His other add-on is good too so that has him batting 2 for 2.

Good job!
Among THE best! Seriously :) Rated 5 out of 5 stars

I very seldom write a review and donate, much less rave about an add on. But this one deserves all the awesome accolades, because it works great right out of the box with options on copying one tab, all tabs in just one window, or every freakin' tab you have open. It has many other features -- but not too many, if you know what I mean -- AND is easily customizable. Now, the default mode does paste the URLs without blank lines between them, which is messy. But as at least one earlier reviewer pointed out, that can be fixed in a jiffy this way by going to "Options" and changing the add-on's code to this:$title $n<a href="$url"></a>$n$n Just experiment with it to make it the format come out the way you like it.
